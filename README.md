Hi, I’m Sophie Quinn! I am...

- A member of the Carleton College class of 2025, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in German and History with an excellent academic record.
- Passionate about using Computer Science to effect real change in the world and in own my communities.
- Currently working on my senior integrative exercise. I am working with a team to implement different algorithms solving the Maximum Clique Problem and test their runtime and effectiveness.
- Simultaneously improving my communication, teamwork, and critical thinking skills by engaging in courses across the curricular spectrum.
  
- Outside of class and CS projects, I enjoy dancing, playing ultimate frisbee, reading, and hanging out with my friends. I'm also a fiend for the outdoors, so catch me in the Arboretum at Carleton or planning my next adventure somewhere new.

- Hi, I’m Sophie Quinn! I am...
- A member of the Carleton College class of 2025, I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in German and History.
- Passionate about using Computer Science to effect real change in the world and in own my communities. I love a good challenge, so the intersection of finding ways to effect positive change with the problem solving inherent in CS strongly appeals to me.
- Currently learning advanced tools and strategies for software design. Specifically, I am working with a group of fellow Carls to create a marketplace for Carleton College students to buy and sell items to each other. 
- Simultaneously improving my communication, teamwork, and critical thinking skills by engaging in courses across the curricular spectrum.
  
- Outside of class and CS projects, I enjoy dancing, playing ultimate frisbee, reading, and hanging out with my friends. I'm also a fiend for the outdoors, so catch me in the Arboretum at Carleton or planning my next adventure somewhere new.
